### Be Informed

Be Informed is a pan global information matrix of humanitarians focused on being a positive force for good in the world, helping to support, awaken and empower our global family with resources to become pro-active in creating positive change in the world. 

We are part of a global movement of inspired, caring individuals who have an alternative vision for the well-being of humanities future, who do not give our consent to the current plan for a micro chipped dystopian smart surveillance society ruled by the elite 0.001% and dominated by corporations and technocracy.  

Knowledge is power. Together, armed with knowledge and strength in numbers we have the power to make necessary changes.  The old world is crumbling before our very eyes and a new one is being formed.  Will we collectively rise from the ashes of the old world like a glorious phoenix carrying the love and wisdom to create a new transformed world or will we be anaesthetised by our own apathy and allow that world to be re-created for us by those who seek to control and dominate us as before?

All around the world, in exponentially increasing numbers, people are rising up together to demand social change, to create information platforms and movements dedicated to this new vision for a sustainable future based on truly humanistic principles that acknowledge the interconnectedness of all life, and the vital importance of our part in taking appropriate action to make this world a happier, more nourishing and more caring place to share with our fellow human beings and the entire ecosystem on which we depend.
