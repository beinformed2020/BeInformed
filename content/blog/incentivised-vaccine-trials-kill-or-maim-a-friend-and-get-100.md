On 19th October 2020 a doctor died in Brazil. He was  28 years old and died of Covid-19-related complications after taking  part in vaccine trials. The [BBC stated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-54634518), according to hearsay, *“the doctor had worked with infected patients,”* but this was not confirmed by the Brazilian Health Authority, Anvisa.  

Knowing the BBC’s history this either means the vaccine companies are looking for a scapegoat on which to blame the doctor’s death, or they  have set up the story of him working with infected patients to catch out independent reporters who might republish it to discredit vaccine  research.  

Regardless of this doctor’s death – sad though that may be – research into a vaccine for Covid-19 is already discredited. It is taking  shortcuts like never before in the history of modern medicine.  Pre-clinical trials used to take years. Not any more.  

On the day the Brazilian doctor died the World Health Organisation (WHO) [issued a statement ](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)in a foreward to its draft landscape on COVID-19 vaccines. It includes  this disclaimer not ostensibly connected with the doctor’s death.  

> WHO […] disclaims any and all liability or responsibility whatsoever for any death, disability, injury, suffering, loss, damage  or other prejudice of any kind that may arise from or in connection with the procurement, distribution or use of any product included in any of  these landscape documents.
