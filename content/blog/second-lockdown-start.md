Almost half of the United States has again restricted movement and  called for measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19. After a week  straight of [more than 100,000 cases per day](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-positive) being diagnosed across the country, [the second lockdown](https://www.theorganicprepper.com/prepare-next-lockdown/) of America has begun.  

It’s important to note that *it doesn’t really matter* whether you personally believe that COVID-19 is risky or not. The issue that  all of us face, regardless of our own belief system, is that another  round of lockdowns is coming. And if you think the last lockdowns  damaged the United States, Round #2 has the potential for even more  extreme repercussions.  

Consider this your early warning to go pick up any last-minute supplies at the store while you still can.
