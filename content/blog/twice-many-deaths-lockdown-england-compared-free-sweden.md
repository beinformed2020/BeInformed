*The graph below is from the [UK’s Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020). The darker line represents England; the lighter is Sweden. The graph  compares all-cause mortality between the two lands based on how many  people died per 100,000 (hence it’s relative regardless of the  population of each country). This isn’t just people who supposedly died  from COVID—it’s people who died from all kinds of diseases, injuries and old age.*
