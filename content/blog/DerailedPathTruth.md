*Here we are. No more speculation about ‘what  awaits around the corner’; the jail keepers are escorting us down the  concrete corridor and the cell keys are hanging from his belt.

***Julian Rose** is an early pioneer  of UK organic farming, writer, international activist, entrepreneur and  teacher. His latest book ‘Overcoming the Robotic Mind – Why Humanity  Must Come Through’ is particularly prescient reading for this time: see [www.julianrose.info](http://www.julianrose.info/).*
