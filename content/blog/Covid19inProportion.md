Includes latest UK data from Office for National Statistics.

[Covid-19 in Proportion?](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/)  

**Summary ;**

~    Overall we are about four weeks behind the mortality count for 2017/2018

 ~   Deaths for the under 65's are very close to where they were in 2017/2018

 ~   Lockdown does not seem to have slowed infections in the under 65's or in flu/respiratory deaths (any age). If you look carefully you can see a slight dip in numbers to reflect delays to death registrations at Christmas. You might think that the lockdown would also have had a noticeable impact on the data but it does not.

 ~   A closer look at the data will reveal that Covid infection rates were already declining before the lockdown which suggests that lockdown did not slow Covid infections either.

~   Weekly death totals reveal large number of "collateral" deaths

~ The lockdown may not be helping

~ In other countries too, stringent lockdowns tend to be linked to higher infection rates

~  Many experts advise that strict lockdown is not the best policy

~ Is the cure worse than the disease?
