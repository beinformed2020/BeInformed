title: "Immunity Certificates and Health Passes Are a Hoax"
draft: false
---

In this article, I once again enter the fictitious world of official  science, where the virus is real, it is attacking people, the test is  accurate, the case numbers are meaningful, the vaccine is necessary.   
Even within that lunatic world, the experts can’t keep their story  straight.   
The contradictions are giant neon signs in the sky, for  people who can see.  

There are two forms of immunity certificates or health passes.   
One  declares the person has recently tested negative for the virus.   
The  other states the person has received the COVID-19 vaccine.  

Untold numbers of people believe the certificates make them “safe.”
