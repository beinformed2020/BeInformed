**Retired doctors, district nurses and physios recruited to administer jab in England’s biggest programme of its kind. **  

> The [NHS](https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs) is bringing together an army of retired doctors, health visitors and  physiotherapists to embark on the country’s biggest ever mass  vaccination programme, the Guardian has learned.
>
> The extraordinary effort in England will also include district nurses and high street chemists alongside GPs in the drive to immunise 22  million vulnerable adults, followed by the rest of the population.
>
> NHS documents seen by the Guardian show the rollout will rely in part on “inexperienced staff” who will have undergone two hours of online  training before starting work.
