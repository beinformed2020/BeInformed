**Permission granted – we’re going to court**  

Back in August, we  announced that together with a cross-party group of MPs – Caroline Lucas (Green), Debbie Abrahams (Labour) and Layla Moran (LibDem) – we were  launching [legal action](https://goodlawproject.org/news/government-refuses-publish-contracts/) against Government for its persistent and unlawful failure to disclose details of COVID-related contracts.
