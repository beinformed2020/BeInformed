## Is the Cure worse than the Cause?  

![Cafe Closed](../ims/cafe_closed.jpg)

On March 23rd 2020 our country, as directed by the government, entered lockdown in an abrupt turn around of approach to controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, having been advised by the recently resigned Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist from Imperial College, London.

The need for lockdown was based on speculative death figures generated from a computer model which referenced a simulated pandemic exercise called Event 201, a global pandemic exercise. This event took place on October 18th 2019 in New York City and was sponsored by the US John Hopkins Centre for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
