CoviLeaks was born in response to mainstream media propaganda and government misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 'pandemic'.   
We believe that the lockdown has had catastrophic consequences leading to excess deaths, poverty and severe economic damage.  
We believe the lockdown and Coronavirus Legislation is wholly disproportionate and an offence on our human rights and civil liberties.  
We have simple aims: To fight for our freedoms, to seek the truth, provide the truth and give a confidential platform to those who want to speak the truth.
