The Crown Copyright Reserved commenced on 1 July 1912, The Copyright Act 1956, The Crown Copyright is now defined in section 163 of the Copyright Designs And Patents Act 1988, The Statutory Register and Records, Birth Marriages Death Land Title and Company Registers. So now you know that the Birth Certificate is not yours. but hold on, my Name(s) and Surname is on that Document.
