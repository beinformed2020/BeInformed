On Saturday a small, socially distanced vigil of 18 people for Julian  Assange at Piccadilly Circus was broken up by twice that number of  police and one elderly man arrested and taken into custody. The little  group of activists have been holding the vigil every week. I had just  arrived to thank them and was astonished to see eight police vans and  this utterly unnecessary police action. There could not be a clearer  example of “Covid legislation” being used to crack down on unrelated,  entirely peaceful political dissent.
