title: "Pfizers Experimental Covid 19 Vaccine What Youre Not Being Told"
draft: false

**Pfizer’s long history of scandals, and the fact that they have never  been held to account for their crimes, continues to be ignored by the  media, even as its experimental mRNA vaccine candidate for Covid-19  draws ever closer to US government approval.**  

The vaccine information war has kicked up a gear, and the mainstream  media vultures are circling to descend on any content that they can  easily label and dismiss as misinformation. [Laws will be passed](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/coronavirus-vaccine-labour-calls-for-emergency-censorship-laws-for-anti-vax-content/ar-BB1b0Ys7?MSCC=1605084351&s=09) throughout legislatures globally to criminalise anyone who publicly  misunderstands any part of the complex biological processes involved in  many of the new experimental vaccine technologies that are being used to produce Covid-19 vaccine candidates.  

Even now, intelligence agencies and intelligence-backed tech companies [are set to deploy sophisticated methods](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/11/reports/us-uk-intel-agencies-declare-cyber-war-on-independent-media/) to censor content and deplatform news websites that they view as  promoting ‘vaccine hesitancy’ as well as ‘vaccine misinformation’,  particularly as a Covid-19 vaccine candidate lurches closer to approval.  

It is expected that by month’s end the mRNA vaccine produced by the scandal-ridden pharmaceutical giant Pfizer [will be approved](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pfizer-eyes-emergency-use-approval-for-vaccine-in-november-2020-10-16) by the US government via an emergency-use authorization, with other  countries expected to follow suit. Pfizer, in anticipation of the  seemingly imminent and assured approval of their vaccine candidate, [has already been manufacturing](https://twitter.com/eToro/status/1318611622714277890) hundreds of millions of doses of its vaccine for weeks and has received praise from governments and mainstream media alike for [its self-reported claims](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/pfizer-says-virus-vaccine-90percent-effective/ar-BB1aQ4mj) that its vaccine is 90 percent effective.
