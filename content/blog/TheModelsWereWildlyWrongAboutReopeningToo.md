Most of the United States entered into a tepid reopening from the COVID  lockdowns in mid-May. Although the reopening process has advanced  through an interminable succession of bureaucratic phases with most of  the country remaining under varying degrees of restriction as of  mid-July, the reopening process has remained under sustained criticism  from the media and a segment of the epidemiology profession since the  moment it started.
