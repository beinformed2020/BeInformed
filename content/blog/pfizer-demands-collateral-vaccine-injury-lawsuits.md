title: "Pfizer Demands Collateral Vaccine Injury Lawsuits"
draft: false
---

- Pfizer is demanding countries put up sovereign  assets, including bank reserves, military bases and embassy buildings,  as collateral for expected vaccine injury lawsuits resulting from its [COVID-19](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) inoculation.
- Argentina and Brazil have rejected Pfizer’s demands. According to legal experts, [Pfizer](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/johns-hopkins-scientist-medical-certainty-pfizer-vaccine-caused-death-florida-doctor/) is abusing its power.
- In the U.S., [vaccine makers](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-pharma/) already enjoy full indemnity against injuries occurring from the  COVID-19 vaccine under the PREP Act. If you’re injured, you’d have to  file a compensation claim with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation  Program (CICP), which is funded by U.S. taxpayers.
- A significant problem with the CICP is that it’s  administered within the Department of Health and Human Services, which  is also sponsoring the COVID-19 vaccination program. This conflict of  interest makes the CICP less likely to admit fault with the vaccine.
- The maximum CICP payout you can receive — even in  cases of permanent disability or death — is $250,000 per person, and you first have to exhaust your private insurance policy before the CICP  kicks in.
