The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance was initially formed  as a working group under “emergency” conditions of the early COVID-19  pandemic in response to multiple early reports of COVID patients with an inexplicably high need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and an  excessive mortality associated with the prevailing “supportive care  only” recommendations disseminated by the majority of national and  international health care organizations.  

As a group of highly published leaders in critical care with  expertise in therapies directed at severe infections – in particular  “HAT” therapy first developed by Dr. Paul Marik for the treatment of  bacterial sepsis – and along with published high patient survival rates  from our centers, we were contacted by equally concerned and motivated  colleagues from other specialties.
