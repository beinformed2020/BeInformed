Ludwig van Beethoven was baptised on 17 December,  1770, and so was probably born on the 16th. I remember the fuss made by  the mainstream media on the occasion of his 200th anniversary just 50  years ago, but where are the mainstream media now? Iâ€™ve heard nothing  from them so far in the UK about the 250th anniversary.  

Could that just be because of the current obsession with COVID-19 and the lockdown, or could there be some other reason for this silence?  After all, Beethoven is still just as popular as he was 50 years ago,  even if playing live music in concert halls is being made impossibly  difficult by The Powers That Be.  

Could it possibly be that reviving the memory of a dissident could be dangerous for the current world order?
