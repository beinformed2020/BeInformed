title: "Canadian Government Delays Mandatory Traveler Quarantine - #SolutionsWatch"
draft: false
---

The Canadian government announced it was going to subject Canadian  residents to mandatory quarantine, at their own expense, after returning from international travel, regardless of their negative COVID status.   

After public backlash and the threat of legal action, the government is  now delaying those plans, but some are alleging that the government has  already arrested Canadians arriving in the country by air and  transported them to a secret hotel location.  

Joining us to discuss this  developing story and what Canadians can do about it is John Carpay of  the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms.
