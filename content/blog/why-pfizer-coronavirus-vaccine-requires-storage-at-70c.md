title: "Why Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine Requires Storage at 70c"
draft: false
---

**The shocking reason why Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C … because it contains experimental nanotech components that have NEVER been used in vaccines before.**  

You’re seeing the reports all over the news: Pfizer’s new coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C (-94F), which is much colder than the North Pole. If it’s not stored at this temperature, its ingredients begin to break down and it fails to work. Currently Pfizer is claiming, without evidence, that its vaccine is “90% effective.” But this claim is little more than corporate propaganda designed to drive up stock prices through false projections.  

But why do these vaccines need to be kept at -70C in the first place?  

The answer, it turns out, is because they contain potentially hazardous ingredients that have never been used in vaccines before.
