**Dr. Mercola, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jeremy Hammond**

Nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the bitter conflict about mask  wearing continues. In my view, the reason for this is because the  science behind the mask mandates is never addressed by the politicians  and public health professionals making the recommendations, and the  media have completely given up on their journalistic duty.  

What you end up with is [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/30/dr-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-chinese-communist-party.aspx) saying things like “the data on mask wearing speaks for itself,”1 without telling you that virtually all studies published to date show  that universal mask wearing does not prevent the spread of viral  illness. The remedy would be journalistic investigation, but the  mainstream media clearly doesn’t fulfill that role anymore.  

It’s one thing to rely on opinion and unsubstantiated belief when making  decisions for your own self. It’s another when opinion is used to  justify public health mandates. When we’re talking about the health of  billions of people, science really should guide the decisions made, and  that means actually taking a cold hard look at the scientific  literature.
