**Increasingly draconian lockdown measures, economic destitution, and sweeping police powers are evaporating public trust and eroding public patience.**  

As the alleged “second wave” of the Coronavirus  “pandemic” is reported to be sweeping across Europe in recent weeks,  many governments have enthusiastically embraced their totalitarian side  and granted themselves sweeping new “emergency powers” alongside new  lockdown measures.  

The public has been markedly less co-operative this time around.  Rebelling against the seemingly arbitrary limitations which are not  supported by either science or common sense. Protests have taken place  all across the continent.
