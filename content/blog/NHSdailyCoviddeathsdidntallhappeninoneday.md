Yes, the “daily covid deaths” include people who *were never tested*. There’s seven of them. Roughly one quarter of the total.

To sum up the situation:

**NHS England’s “daily Covid deaths” didn’t all happen in one day, and probably didn’t all have Covid.**

This is not at all new information to anybody who has been paying  attention, but it bears repeating. They are clearly going out of their  way to manipulate the numbers. 

People need to be shown this so they will naturally ask the follow-up question: *Why would they want to do that?*
