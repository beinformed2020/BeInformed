title: "Jeremy Kauffman Introduces Lbry and Odysee: CorbettReport"
draft: false
---

Jeremy Kauffman joins us to discuss LBRY, an open-source, decentralized  protocol that is helping creators share video content peer-to-peer  through the LBRY app and LBRY.tv. Today we talk about the newly-launched LBRY web portal, [Odysee.com](https://odysee.com/), and how the LBRY app was (briefly) banned from the Google Playstore in the latest attempt to burn the LBRY of Alexandria.
