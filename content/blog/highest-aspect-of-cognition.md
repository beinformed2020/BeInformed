**How to awaken others to the COVID hoax by rousing their “highest aspects of cognition”**

This month, the revolution against COVID-19(84) totalitarianism has been rising up with about a million [protestors in Berlin](https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/end-of-the-pandemic/) and somewhere between  10,000 and 100,000 in [Montreal](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/anti-mask-march-montreal-aug-8-1.5679598). While these are positive signs, I also am concerned that we are  fighting fire with fire. And the tyrants have far more firepower than we can ever muster.   

Are we not fighting state collectivism with an anarchistic form of  collectivism? Media talk with alternative talk? Even if the majority  started denouncing the COVID-19 narrative, such a vocal, unified  movement, in itself, would not make what the WHO has done right or  wrong. Such activism is focused on social persuasion rather than  appealing to reason and conscience.   

“Look, it’s been three months, four months, however long it’s been, and I’ve kept quiet,” says Rose Davidson in [a viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq40UaGGYFc). “I’ve been like: You know, we gotta do what we gotta do. Blah, blah,  blah…. I kept quiet. I’m not gonna be quiet anymore. Because I don’t  want any more months of this. If we all grew some balls and did the  right thing this wouldn’t have been happening… I wish I was saying  exactly what I’m saying now on March 11.”
