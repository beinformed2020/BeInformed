 Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock said  the UK government is “working as hard as we can” to get a Covid-19  vaccine ready, and he confirmed the military would be involved in  “making the rollout happen.”     

Speaking at a virtual Conservative Party conference about the pandemic, Hancock said the *“armed services”* and the contact-tracing app NHS will both be implemented in deciding how to distribute a potential vaccine *“according to clinical need.”*
