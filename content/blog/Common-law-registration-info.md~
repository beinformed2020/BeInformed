The Common Law Court has created an International database for all living men and women. By submitting a declaration for your birth, you have confirmed that you exist.

Currently, the only existing record for you is a legal fiction which the state has attached to you; this means that you fall under their rules. By recording your birth with the Common Law Court, you now have an option, you can remain under the statutory system and rules or stand under the authority and jurisdiction of the Common Law Court.

There is no charge for recording any information with the Common Law Court.

• Once completed and submitted, your birth certificate number will be emailed
to you within 24 hours

3. Take ownership of your ‘legal fiction’ NAME:
