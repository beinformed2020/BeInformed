I never expected to be writing something like this. I am an ordinary  person, recently semi-retired from a career in the pharmaceutical  industry and biotech, where I spent over 30 years trying to solve  problems of disease understanding and seek new treatments for allergic  and inflammatory disorders of lung and skin. I’ve always been interested in problem solving, so when anything biological comes along, my  attention is drawn to it. Come 2020, came SARS-CoV-2. I’ve [written about the pandemic](https://lockdownsceptics.org/addressing-the-cv19-second-wave/) as objectively as I could. The scientific method never leaves a person  who trained and worked as a professional scientist. Please do read that  piece. My co-authors & I will submit it to the normal rigours of  peer review, but that process is slow and many pieces of new science  this year have come to attention through pre-print servers and other  less conventional outlets.
