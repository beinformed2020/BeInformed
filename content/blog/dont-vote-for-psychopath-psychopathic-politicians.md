Politicians are [more likely](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-freeman/are-politicians-psychopaths_b_1818648.html) than people in the general population to be sociopaths.   

“*I think you  would find no expert in the field of sociopathy/psychopathy/antisocial  personality disorder who would dispute this… That a small minority of  human beings literally have no conscience was and is a bitter pill for  our society to swallow — but it does explain a great many things,  shamelessly deceitful political behavior being one.*”—*Dr. Martha Stout, clinical psychologist and former instructor at Harvard Medical School*
