title: "Is the Nhs Actually Quieter Than Usual Leaked Document Claims Hospitals Are 84 Full but Last Autumn the Figure Was 92"
draft: false
---

\* Beds have never been less than 85% full for a three-month period since 2010   
\* Spring this year was the first time, because patients were turfed out for Covid-19  
\* And occupancy remains below average levels despite second wave, stat shows   
\* Boris Johnson has returned to his ‘protect the NHS’ slogan for second lockdown    

NHS hospitals in England appear quieter than usual for this time of year even though they are treating more than 9,000 patients  with coronavirus.
