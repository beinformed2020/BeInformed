1. 5G will transmit power in narrow, high-power beams. Our exposure standard evaluates average exposures. The average may be lower than 2G/3G/4G because the 5G  component will only transmit when being used. But during use, the energy in the beams will be high. The beams will interact with  people/animals/trees. This is the first time these beams have been  intended for public devices used against the body. Increased use, even  5G device ownership, will mean increased exposure.
2. If a transmitting phone is used/stored against the head or body  research indicates that permitted 5G exposures could cause burns.  Although the RMA regulations do not permit exceeding public limits, it  seems exposure could cause burns within those limits. This, and other  research, demonstrates there are RMA ‘effects’ from phone exposures, so  the RMA is not in line with the exposure standard.
3. The user will be exposed to 5G beams when the phone is receiving and sending information. Current phones increase exposure only when  sending.
4. Private phones may be used to support Telco infrastructure to  re-direct others’ wireless traffic when there are insufficient public  transmitters, further increasing personal exposures.
5. Most 5G energy is expected to be absorbed in the top layers of the  skin, deep enough to impact on peripheral blood vessels. This does not  seem to have been tested or considered.
