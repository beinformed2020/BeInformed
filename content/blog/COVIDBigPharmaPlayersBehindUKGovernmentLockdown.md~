*"To achieve world government, it is necessary to remove from the  minds of men their individualism, loyalty to family tradition, national  patriotism, and religious dogmas."*
 — Dr George Brock Chisholm, who served as the first Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) from 1948 to 1953  

[UK Column](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/covid%E2%80%9319-big-pharma-players-behind-uk-government-lockdown)  

In Part One of *[Who controls the British Government response to Covid–19?](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/who-controls-british-government-response-covid19-part-one)*, I began an investigation into the individuals and entities that are,  effectively, driving the UK Government response to Covid–19. In Part  Two, I will expand upon the Big Pharma and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  links already identified and will introduce new connections that appear  to have considerable bearing upon the UK Government's Covid–19 strategy. I will expand upon the Bill Gates connections to the various  organisations that are advocating global immunisation.
