title: "5 Million Australians Arrested"
draft: false

In [yesterday’s post](https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/melbourne-police-state), I shared how the premiere of Victoria, Australia put five million  people under house arrest. Drones hover over parks. Police enter homes  without warrant and remove people to quarantine facilities. Surely, to  justify destroying the economy, traumatizing children and [1200 suicides ](https://7news.com.au/the-morning-show/gus-worland-talks-mental-health-during-covid-and-the-alarming-rate-of-suicide-in-australia-c-1221236)(since March) kangaroos must be dropping dead in the streets from COVID.

Alas, no. According to the [WHO](https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/au), as of August 25, Australia has had a total of 517 deaths (many of which I doubt were actually caused by COVID-19… but let’s assume it’s all  legit).
