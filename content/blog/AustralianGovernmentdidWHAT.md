TIME TO FIRE UP ! 

Speech in Parliament this afternoon.  
This speech is from what is called the 'Federation Chamber' which is a secondary debating Chamber to the main floor of Parliament.  
ONE CHANCE IN 20 MILLION  HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine) is an effective treatment for COVID-19.  
The probability that an ineffective treatment generated results as positive as the 115 studies to date is estimated to be 1 in 20 million (p = 0.000000049).  
100% of early treatment studies have found HCQ has positive results for covid patients.
