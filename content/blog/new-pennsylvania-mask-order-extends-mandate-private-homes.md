title: "New Pennsylvania Mask Order Extends Mandate Private Homes"
draft: false
---

An updated version of Pennsylvania's mask mandate extends its face-covering order to private homes, greatly expanding the reach of the order amid rising positive test results in the state.   

The revised version of the "Universal Face Coverings" order, issued this week, dictates that "every individual, age two and older, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall wear a face covering" when "indoors or in an enclosed space, where another person or persons who are not members of the individual's household are present in the same space, irrespective of physical distance."
