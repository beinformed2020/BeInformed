**The COVID crisis has given the State unprecedented new powers  which politicians are more than willing to use in order to further  consolidate power. Has Boris Johnson decreed mandatory masks to follow  suite with Nicola Sturgeon’s diktat north of the border? But are the  public aware of the long-term costs to democracy and society as whole?**  

In this brief video, international best-selling author, **Dr Vernon Coleman** MB ChB DSc FRSA, describes how we can fight against the government’s  obsession with mandatory masks, as well the the incessant media lies  which are being used to promote the idea of more unnecessary lockdowns,  social distancing and the banning of cash.
