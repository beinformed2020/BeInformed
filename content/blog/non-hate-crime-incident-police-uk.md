Something has gone seriously wrong in this country, when the  police take it upon themselves to intimidate a 14 year-old schoolgirl by making an official record of her innocuous statement in class.       

The girl, known only as Miss B, became a target of police interest because she, along with millions of  other people, took the view that sex is distinct from gender identity.  At a time when it is increasingly verboten to question trans ideology’s  claims on the subjectivity of both sex and gender identity, Miss B’s  views are too often condemned as hatred.   

Miss B, who has  indicated that she is ‘frightened about speaking openly on transgender  issues’ is – along with her parents – seeking legal recourse and  challenging the decision of the police to classify her comment as a  non-crime hate incident. Her lawyers’ letter to the College of Policing  states that Miss B is ‘concerned about the possibility of having a  police record potentially including details of conversations that she  has had at school’ and fears ‘this record would impact on her future  career prospects.’
