**World Economic Forum’s video tells us about the plans for humanity in the year 2030**  

The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting at  the end of January in Davos, Switzerland, brings together international  business and political leaders, economists and other high-profile  individuals to discuss global issues.   

Driven by the vision of its influential CEO Klaus Schwab, the WEF is the main driving force for the [dystopian ‘great reset’](https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/12/klaus-schwab-his-great-fascist-reset/), a tectonic shift that intends to change how we live, work and interact with each other.
