THE HEALTH SERVICE EXECUTIVE OF IRELAND ARE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT 'COVID-19' DOES NOT EXIST  

> "As part of our legal action we had been demanding the evidence that this virus actually exists [as well as] evidence that lockdowns actually have any impact on the spread of viruses; that face-masks are safe, and do deter the spread of viruses - They donâ€™t. No such studies exist; that social distancing is based in science - It isn't. it's made up; that contact tracing has any bearing on the spread of a virus - of course it doesn't. This organisation here - is making it up as they go along." - Gemma O'Doherty
