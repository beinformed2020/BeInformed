"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and  opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an  invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We  are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas  suggested, largely by men we have never heard of."   
~ Edward Bernays
