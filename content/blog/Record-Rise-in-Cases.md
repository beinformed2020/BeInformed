title: "Record Rise in 'Cases' – But October Still Normal For Respiratory Disease"
draft: false
---

**Yesterday saw the biggest daily rise yet in positive tests reported:  26,688. The last three days have each seen significant increases, though it’s worth noting that by date of specimen there is still no major  upward trend since the start of the month. That may change in the coming days (the column for October 19th admittedly looks high already) but  relying on reporting date can give a false impression of trends.**
