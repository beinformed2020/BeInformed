**Signs of the times—**

Large anti-lockdown protests are sweeping across Europe.  Denmark,  France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Poland.  The media are trying to put a  lid on coverage of these momentous events.  

In Southern California, five sheriffs of populous counties (17  million people) are refusing to enforce Governor Newsom’s new curfew  order.  A petition to recall the governor is gaining steam.  

In New York, members of the Chasidic sect held a wedding attended by several thousand people, [sitting closely packed without masks](https://nypost.com/2020/11/21/secret-plans-helped-synagogue-pull-off-massive-maskless-wedding/).  

In a more intimate setting, up close and powerfully personal, gym members and owners in Buffalo, New York, [shouted down cops and a public health officer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_pkvlp2q4), who had entered the gym because the gathering exceeded the prescribed  limit.  The gym personnel drove out the cops and followed them, to make  sure they left the property.
