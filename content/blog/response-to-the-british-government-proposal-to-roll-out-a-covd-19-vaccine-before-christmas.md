Guest Editorial by John Stone, UK Editor, Age of Autism  

The British government are running a [public consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/distributing-vaccines-and-treatments-for-covid-19-and-flu) with a view to cutting every corner and safeguard in order to roll out a COVID vaccine campaign before Christmas (the British “warp-speed”).  presumably with the Oxford/Astra-Zeneca product in mind. For anyone who  wants to respond it ends this Friday (18 September).   

This how I have  responded to the on-line form.
