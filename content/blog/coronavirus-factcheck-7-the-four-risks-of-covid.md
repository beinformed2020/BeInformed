In today’s [“Covid briefing”](https://www.dumptheguardian.com/politics/live/2020/sep/21/uk-coronavirus-news-latest-whitty-and-vallance-to-present-data-showing-how-trend-in-uk-heading-in-wrong-direction?page=with:block-5f687d9a8f089b7b17dba029#block-5f687d9a8f089b7b17dba029) Chris Whitty – the UK’s Chief Medical Officer – outlined that the  Sars-Cov-2 virus poses four types of risk.
