On Monday January 25, 2021, John Bush spoke at the inaugural The Greater Reset Activation! John talks about how Agorism can be the solution to the agenda behind Agenda 21/2030 and The World Economic Forum's The Great Reset.  

John Bush is a radical activist, entrepreneur, and father of two based in Austin, TX. Since 2002 he has worked tirelessly to create a more free and peaceful world through political activism and the promotion of alternative institutions. He is a proponent of health freedom and operates Brave Botanicals which offers kratom and CBD. He also founded the Live Free Now podcast. In 2015 he laid out his vision for Freedom Cells, small mutual aid groups networked with other cells to achieve common goals and secure the sovereignty of group members. The Freedom Cell Network has since grown to over 9,500 people globally and hopes to one day replace the state as a means of social organization.
