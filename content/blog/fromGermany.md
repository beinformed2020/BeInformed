Hello, I'm writing to you from Germany.   
Don't worry anymore. The 29th. 8th in Berlin will be historic. I just received news that is not yet for advertising. I'm telling you this to cheer you up:  
The demonstration has about 5 million demonstrators. The purpose is to stay until the government falls.  
We have food and drink for five days.  
An airline that does not yet want to go out in public is bringing in protesters from many parts of the world. If the government falls, they give the money back to the passengers!  
Several bus companies do the same. 1200 buses bring protesters from many cities in Europe. They will not return until the government falls.  
A general of the German military is going to resign on the stage. Boats and boats are going to blockade the river Spree. Even helicopters will demonstrate in the air. The police are on our side. They won't intervene for masks or distance.  
We want to paralyze all of Berlin. Camps will be set up all over Berlin.
