**Judges are fighting back against Boris Johnson - and they're right**  

Boris Johnson is said to be bad at making friends, but he is good at making  enemies. This week he has added judges and bishops to his lengthening  list. The departing and longest-serving supreme court justice, Lord  Kerr, has [condemned](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/oct/19/uk-needs-judges-to-limit-government-power-says-lord-kerr) the prime minister’s persistent abuse of the judiciary as “unbridled  power” and a “slippery slope to dictatorship”. This comes on top of a  statement from the leaders of the UK’s Anglican churches deploring  Johnson’s admission of law-breaking over Brexit as a “[disastrous precedent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54592062)”. Such a breach of political protocol by the church is most unusual.
