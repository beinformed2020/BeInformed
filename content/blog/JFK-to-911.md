Authoritatively written and narrated by Francis Richard Conolly, the  film begins its labyrinthine tale during the era of World War I, when  the wealthiest and most powerful figures of industry discovered the  immense profits to be had from a landscape of ongoing military conflict.  
 The film presents a persuasive and exhaustively researched argument  that these towering figures formed a secret society by which they could  orchestrate or manipulate war-mongering policies to their advantage on a global scale, and maintain complete anonymity in their actions from an  unsuspecting public.  
Conolly contends that these sinister puppet masters have functioned and thrived throughout history - from the formation of  Nazism to the build-up and aftermath of September 11.
