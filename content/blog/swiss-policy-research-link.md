SPR has published a comprehensive new update on recent medical and political developments concerning Covid-19. This is our final regular update on Covid-19.

Most importantly, a new preprint study by leading Swiss immunologists shows that coronavirus blood antibody tests may detect at most 20% of all infections, as most people neutralize the virus with their mucosal or innate immune system, developing only mild or no symptoms.

This means that Covid-19 is likely much more widespread than previously assumed, and its infection fatality rate (IFR) may drop well below 0.1% and thus into the range of a strong seasonal influenza, as already predicted by several epidemiological experts.

In recent months, SPR has reached millions of people in close to 30 languages from around the globe. We would like to thank our readers for their extremely valuable feedback.
