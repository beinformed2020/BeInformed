We write to you as legal practitioners and legal academics to express our collective concerns about the violations of Mr. Julian Assange’s  fundamental human, civil and political rights and the precedent his  persecution is setting.

We call on you to act in accordance with national and international  law, human rights and the rule of law by bringing an end to the ongoing  extradition proceedings and granting Mr. Assange his long overdue  freedom – freedom from torture, arbitrary detention and deprivation of  liberty, and political persecution.
