​        A Victoria man was left in a medically-induced coma after a  brutal arrest in which police hit him with a cruiser before one of the  responding officers stomped on the man’s head as his colleagues held him down.     

The man, identified as  Timothy Atkins, reportedly lives with bipolar disorder and had been  waiting for more than a day for mental health help inside the nearby  Northern Hospital in Epping, just north of Melbourne, before he gave up  and walked out.
