Dozens have been detained and fined as anti-government protesters  held numerous smaller rallies in Israel in defiance of coronavirus  lockdown measures that ban people from gathering more than 1km from  home.

At least 38 activists were detained in Tel Aviv alone for *“violating public order”* and allegedly *“attacking police officers,”* [according](https://www.timesofisrael.com/tens-of-thousands-protest-netanyahu-across-israel-after-law-limits-rallies/) to the Times of Israel.

Multiple people were wounded in clashes, including Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai,  who received an injury to his hand, as protesters accused police of  using excessive force.
