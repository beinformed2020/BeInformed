title: "Top UK scientists urge govt to protect most vulnerable from Covid-19 instead of carpet-bombing virus"
draft: false

**The UK should focus on helping the most vulnerable –  including residents in care homes worst affected by Covid-19 – instead  of pursuing an “unfeasible” goal of suppressing the virus until a  vaccine arrives, top scientists urged.**

British scholars penned an open letter to PM Boris Johnson,  Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, as well as health chiefs in  England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, asking them to urgently  reconsider the current epidemic strategy.

Authored by Oxford professors Sunetra Gupta and Carl Heneghan, as  well as Karol Sikora of the University of Buckingham and Sam Williams of the Economic Insight consultancy, the letter says the “existing policy  path is inconsistent with the known risk-profile of Covid-19.” The  appeal has been signed by dozens of academics from the UK’s leading  educational institutions.

> ***The unstated objective currently appears to be one of  suppression of the virus, until such a time that a vaccine can be  deployed. This objective is increasingly unfeasible… and is leading to  significant harm across all age groups, which likely offsets all  benefits.\***
