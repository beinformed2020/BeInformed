Lies and Corruption to the nth Degree involving Dr. Anthony Fauci, “The Boston Connection” and Gilead Sciences Inc.  
The Gilead Sciences Inc. Remdesivir study (50+ authors) was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (April 10, 2020).  

It was followed by the NIH-NIAID [Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764?query=recirc_mostViewed_railB_article) on May 22, 2020 in the NEJM.  And on that same day, May 22, the [“fake report” on Hydroxychloroquine](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6.pdf) by BWH-Harvard Dr. Mehra was published by The Lancet.  
Harvard Medical School and the BWH  bear responsibility for having hosted and financed the fake Lancet  report on HCQ coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra.  
Is there conflict of interest? BWH was simultaneously involved in a study on Remdesivir in contract with Gilead Sciences, Inc.  

While the Lancet report coordinated by Harvard’s Dr. Mehra was  retracted, it nonetheless served the interests of Gilead Sciences Inc.

It is important that an independent  scientific and medical assessment be undertaken, respectively of the  Gilead Sciences Inc New England Journal of Medicine (NEMJ) peer reviewed study (April 10, 2020) as well as the NIH-NIAID study also published in the NEJM (May 22, 2020).
