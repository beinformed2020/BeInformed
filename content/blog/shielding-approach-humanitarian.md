**CDC: Interim Operational Considerations for  Implementing the Shielding Approach  to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in  Humanitarian Settings**  

**What is the Shielding Approach**  

> The shielding approach aims to reduce the number of severe COVID-19  cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of  developing severe disease (“high-risk”) and the general population  (“low-risk”). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to  safe or “green zones” established at the household, neighborhood,  camp/sector or community level depending on the context and setting.They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.
