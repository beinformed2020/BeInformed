title: "Covid19 Pcr Tests Are Scientifically Meaningless"
draft: false

**Though the whole world relies on RT-PCR to “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, the science is clear: they are not fit for purpose**  

Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are  based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called  SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby  “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”  

But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR  tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged  infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.
