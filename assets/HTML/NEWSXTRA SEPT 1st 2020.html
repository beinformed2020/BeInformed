Mainstream news media paid little attention disrespecting it</p><p class="s2">as far right conspiracy theorists. But who were they? What were they rallying for?</p><p class="s8">The event was organised by StandupX, a brand new community of people who are resisting “the new normal”. It was attended by</p><p class="s8">35,000 people from all walks of life and political leanings and lasted over 4 hours. There were many key speakers including Doctors, health experts and researchers calling for an end to government draconian lockdown control measures which are causing fear and suffering to millions of people. The speeches were followed by a peaceful march through Whitehall. One of the organisers, Piers Corbyn aged 73 was singled out and arrested at the last minute from “high up orders” despite full police support. He was held for 10 hours and fined £10,000. Piers Morgan and his co hosts attacked Mr Corbyn’s actions on Good Morning Britain (see youtube).</p><p class="s8">What StandupX are demanding from government is to save future generations from the long planned total control, 24/7 surveillance and mandatory biometric digital ID2020 health passports which will require vaccination or no travel. Also a stop to tracking and rationing of personal freedoms based on compliance or non compliance to government orders. The event’s rallying call is to say:</p><p class="s8">NO TO  <span class="s9">8 </span>NEW NORMAL <span class="s9">8 </span>MANDATORY COVID VACCINE <span class="s9">8 </span>SURVEILLANCE TRACKING <span class="s9">8 </span>5G</p><p class="s9">8 <span class="s8">FASCISM </span>8 <span class="s8">CASHLESS SOCIETY </span>8 <span class="s8">SOCIAL DISTANCING </span>8 <span class="s8">PROJECT FEAR </span>8 <span class="s8">MANDATORY MASKS</span></p><p class="s8">YES TO  <span class="s9">4 </span>CHILDREN’S HEALTH <span class="s9">4 </span>COMMON SENSE <span class="s9">4 </span>TRUE DEMOCRACY <span class="s9">4 </span>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND SPEECH</p><p class="s9">4 <span class="s8">HUMAN RIGHTS </span>4 <span class="s8">DIGNITY AND RESPECT </span>4 <span class="s8">MEDICAL SOVEREIGNTY </span>4 <span class="s8">FREEDOM </span>4 <span class="s8">COMMUNITY </span>4 <span class="s8">CHOICE</span></p><p><a href="http://www.mp-22.com/">www.standupx.info Other pro freedom groups are: Keep Britain Free www.keepbritainfree.com  Mirror Project www.mp-22.com</a></p><p class="s8">Power to the people UK www.powertothepeopleuk.com Free Nation freenation.today Be Informed beinformed.info</p><p class="s8">Useful resources: (youtube) Professor Dolores Cahill, Dr Vernon Coleman, The Corbett Report, UK Column News, Spiro Skouras.</p><p><span><IMG width="703" height="1" src="NEWSXTRA SEPT 1st 2020/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s6">Did you know that at the same time, there were a number of other peaceful FREEDOM RALLIES around the world?</p><p class="s8">In Berlin, Germany on 29th August, <b>Robert F.

Not leaders who make up arbitrary rules and regulations to orchestrate obedience of the population.<br/>We want health officials, who don’t have financial entanglements with<br/>the pharmaceutical industry who are working for us and not big pharma.<br/>We want officials who care about our children’s health and not about pharmaceutical profits or government control.<br/>I look at this crowd - I see all the flags of Europe - I see people of every colour - I see people of every nation, every religion, all caring about human dignity - about children’s health - about political freedom. This is the opposite of Nazi’ism.</p><p class="s10">“the pandemic is a crisis of convenience for the elites who are dictating these policies”</p><p class="s10">RFKJr.</p><p class="s11">Children’s Health Defense</p><p><a href="http://www.childrenshealthdefense.org/" class="s12">www.childrenshealthdefense.org</a><br/>Governments love pandemics. They love pandemics for the same reason they love war. Because it gives them the ability to impose controls on the population that the population would otherwise never accept. The great institutions and mechanisms for orchestrating and imposing obedience.<br/>Now I’ll tell you something, it’s a mystery to me that all these important people like Bill Gates and Tony Fauci<span class="s13">* </span>have been planning and thinking about this pandemic for decades. Planning it so that we would all be safe when the pandemic finally came and yet, now that it’s here, they don’t seem to know what they are talking about. They seem to be making it up as they go along. They are inventing numbers. They cannot tell you what the case fatality rate for covid is. That basic. They cannot give us a PCR test that actually works. They have to change the definition on the death certificates constantly to make it<br/>look more and more dangerous. The one thing that they are good at is pumping up fear.<br/>75 years ago, Hermann Goering<span class="s13">** </span>testified at the Nuremberg trials and he was asked “how did you make the German people go along with all of this?” and he said “It’s an easy thing. It’s not anything to do with Nazi’ism. It has to do with human nature. You can do this in a Nazi regime, you can do it in a Socialist regime, you can do it in a Communist regime, you can do it in a monarchy and a democracy. The only thing a government needs to make people into slaves is fear and if you can figure out something to make them scared you can get them to do anything that you want.”<br/>50 year’s ago, my uncle John Kennedy came to this city. He came here to Berlin because Berlin was the front line against global totalitarianism and today again, Berlin is the front line against global totalitarianism. My uncle came here, he proudly said to the people of Germany “Ich bin ein Berliner” and today all those here today can proudly say once again “Ich bin ein Berliner”. You are the front line against totalitarianism.<br/>I’m going to say one more thing. They haven’t done a very good job about protecting public health but they’ve done a very good job of using the quarantine to bring 5G into all of our communities and to shift us all to begin the process of shifting us all to a digital currency which is the beginning of slavery, because if they control your bank account, they control your<br/>behaviour. And we all see these advertisements on television saying 5G is coming to your community. It’s going to be a great thing for all of you. It’s going to change your lives. It’s going to make all your lives so much better and it’s very convincing I have to say as I look at those ads and I think, that’s great I can’t hardly wait till it gets here. And then I’m going to be able to download a video game in six seconds instead of 16 seconds and is that why they are spending 5 trillion dollars on 5G?<br/>No. The reason is for surveillance and data harvesting. It’s not for you and me. It’s for Bill Gates, it’s for [Mark] Zuckerberg<span class="s13">***</span>, and it’s for Bezos and all of the other billionaires. Bill Gates says that his satellite fleet will be able to look at every square inch of the planet 24 hours a day and that’s only the beginning. He also will be able to follow you on all of your smart devices through biometric facial recognition, through your GPS. You think that Alexis is working for you! She isn’t working for you. She’s working for Bill Gates, spying on you. And the pandemic is a crisis of convenience for the elites who are dictating these policies. It gives them the ability to obliterate the middle class, to destroy the insitutions of<br/>democracy - to shift all of our wealth from all of us to a handful of billionaires to make themselves rich by impoverishing the rest of us and the only thing between them and our children is this crowd that has come to Berlin. You are telling them today, you are not going to take away our freedoms, you are not going to poison our children. We are going to demand our democracy back.<br/>Thank you all very much for fighting.<span class="s1">” Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></p><p class="s14">*[Anthony Stephen Fauci is one of the lead members of the Trump administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force] [** Hermann Goering Nazi political / military leader aside Adolf Hitler] ***[Correction Jeffrey Zuckerberg he meant Mark Zuckerberg Facebook CEO]</p></body></html>
