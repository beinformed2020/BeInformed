• The banner at the top of the first page could be softened and extended to include the phoenix logo (to follow).  The warning sign is bit ominous - looks like a virus warning - which it kind of is, but better that comes from the website material itself.  We can change the colour to suit the logo as we only used blue on the leaflet because we wanted to look like the leaflet was coming from the government at first glance.  The website is a different consideration to the leaflet as there is already interest if someone has bothered to log on.

 • Currently there are no images except for the ones in the leaflet - so it looks very grey and looks like it's still being built (which it is, obviously).  It would be good to change that but it obviously needs the graphic content and not sure who is best for that within our team.  Any suggestions? Yourself or Luke or Dave or maybe one of Greg’s contacts?   Wants to be simple, warm, elegant and engaging.  

 • Home Page. We are thinking it is good for the homepage to be the leaflet text for now but that we should write a basic introduction to the page and the overall contents of the website to go at the top of the page (see Note 1).  We feel it is good for the ongoing updated blog to be an aspect of the home page but needs a welcoming intro.  This can then feed into the leaflet text / timeline as yet that is currently there.

 • The ‘About ‘ section should really be solely about our beliefs - our Mission Statement, an opportunity to dream the dream awake - inspire people by what we want to bring in. (See Note 2.) 

 • We would like to name the titles differently. Home - Topical Trues - The Rabbit Warren.   The blog could do with being labelled what it is - Topical Trues from the Net' or something like this - so people know it isn't our own stuff but just directing them to astute fresh resistance media. Even just 'Latest News’.  The Rabbit Warren (called categories now) - this phrase in and of itself is powerful because people understand what it means , and the implications for going down it!  Within the Rabbit Warren we would like to categorise as follows:  Video Resources (All videos) - Information Resources (Articles) Pro-Active Resources (pro-active steps to take)  - Info Graphics (as you have) - Links (to other websites - see next point below) - Leaflet Downloads (currently leaflet downloads - Main leaflet pdf & Mask graphic).  Naturally there will be cross linking.

 • We would definitely like to have a space for recommended sites on there and begin by partnering with the amazing pe
